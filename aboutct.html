<h2 style="font-family: Arial">What is CT?</h2>
<p>Well I am CT! Not the website, but the person making the site that you are currently on. Kinda flattering you care so much about me to read a lot of words about me. ^^</p>
<br>
<p>If this site is awful, it's to be expected, it's my first site, so this is more so an experiment to mess around instead of actually a site I'm making</p>
<br>
<p>Thanks for stopping by, but I have some more breat52's to hate :3</p>
